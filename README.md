# Constructive Ordering Finder in Rust
This repository contains Rust implementations of two algorithms to compute the number of constructive orderings of the groups ℤ/nℤ, and a supporting library. Consult each subproject for specific READMEs

## Building and Running
All projects can be built with `cargo`:
```bash
cargo build
```

or

```bash
cargo build -r
```

`cof_tree` and `cof_linear` can then be run, also with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo run
```

or

```bash
cargo run -r
```
